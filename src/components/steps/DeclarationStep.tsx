Before booking, I have read the AHC Requirements and confirm that the pet(s) meet(s) the eligibility criteria for obtaining an AHC. I understand that any errors could invalidate the AHC and that the AHC is valid for entry to the EU for up to ten days from its date of issue, and for up to four months (120 days) for onward travel within the EU and/or for re-entry to Great Britain. Therefore, if the pet(s) will be returning within this timeframe, it is essential to ensure that the AHC will still be valid upon re-entry.`;
